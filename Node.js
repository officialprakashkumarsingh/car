// This file appears to be incorrectly named or intended for a different purpose.
 // Based on the context, it seems the user might have meant to create a Node.js-related file,
 // but the project described is a static HTML/CSS/JS site for Emojipedia.
 // Since the task focuses on a static site and no Node.js functionality is required,
 // this file will serve as a placeholder or be removed.
 // If Node.js functionality (e.g., a simple server) is needed later, this file can be updated.

console.log("This is a placeholder for Node.js functionality. Currently, Emojipedia is a static site.");
// No further Node.js code is necessary for the current implementation.
// If a server or backend is required in the future, this file can be expanded.
